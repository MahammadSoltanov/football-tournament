# ⚽ PES 2013 Tournament Manager

## 📝 Description
A lightweight desktop application for managing small PES 2013 tournaments. Built as a personal project to sharpen my skills in WPF, MVVM, and working with databases using Dapper. It supports basic tournament setup, team management, and result tracking.

This was my first serious project and my first time working with a UI. It helped me understand the full flow of building a functional desktop app from start to finish.

## 🧠 Key Features
- Create and manage team tournaments  
- Add/edit team info 
- Auto-generate standings and rankings  
- Simple UI with multiple views (2–3) and view models (3–4)  
- Lightweight data access using Dapper  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)  
- C#  
- MVVM pattern  
- Dapper (micro ORM)  
- XAML for UI layout  

## 🎯 Learning Focus
- Practicing MVVM architecture in desktop apps  
- Building multi-view WPF applications  
- Gaining experience with lightweight data access (Dapper)  
- Strengthening event-driven and UI-bound logic handling  

## 🚧 Notes
This was a self-driven project that allowed me to tie together UI logic, state management, and data flow in a practical context. While basic, it reflects my ability to plan and build a feature-complete app from scratch using clean code principles.
